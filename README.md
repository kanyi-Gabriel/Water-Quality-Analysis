# Maji Ndogo Water Project 

##  Project Overview
The **Maji Ndogo Water Project** focuses on assessing the **integrity and accuracy of water services data** collected by surveyors compared to an independent auditor’s report.  
The goal is to identify inconsistencies, biases, and potential errors in the dataset to ensure reliable information for **decision-making, governance, and resource allocation**.

This project combines **SQL-based data analysis** with **Python-driven exploration** to validate data quality and uncover insights.

##  Key Objectives
- Assess the **accuracy of field data** collected by surveyors.  
- Compare **auditor reports** against raw survey data.  
- Identify **biases, inconsistencies, and anomalies** in the dataset.  
- Provide a framework for **transparent monitoring** of water services.
